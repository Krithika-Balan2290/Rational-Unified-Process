#Life Cycle of the Unified Process

#####Inception Phase
In this phase the business case for the system and the scope of the project is decided. in order to do so, all the external entities and factors are identified, so that we can design how the system is going to interact with the whole system at very high level. The use cases are designed for the system all the important and significant use cases are identified. By saying that the business case is being is decided we mean that the risk assessment is done, success criteria is created and also an estimate for the amount of resources needed is created. A plan showing all major milestones with dates are decided during this phase.

The outcome of this phase is:
* A vision document: a general vision of the core project's requirements, key features, and main constraints.
* A initial use-case model.
* An initial project guideline or domain model.
* An initial business case, which includes business context, success criteria and financial forecast. 
* An initial risk assessment. 
* A project plan, showing phases and iterations.
* A business model, if necessary. 
* One or several prototypes. 
 
The milestone achieved at this phase of the project is- Lifestyle Objectives.


#####Elaboration Phase
The purpose of this phase is to analyze the problem domain and also build the architectural foundation, develop a cohesive project plan and eliminate all the high risk elements. Architectural decisions have to be made with an understanding of the whole system: scope, functionality and nonfunctional requirements such as performance. 
The elaboration phase is one of the most critical phases amongst all the four phases in the process. The elaboration phase is responsible for the partial implementation of the system. It involves the implementation of the core architectural features along with some of the significant components.  The final deliverable of the elaboration phase is a plan for the construction phase. the plan includes cost estimates and time schedules. At this phase, the plan should be accurate and credible as all the significant risk factors have been addressed by this time.

These are the outcomes achieved in the elaboration phase:
* A use-case model where all use cases and actors have been identified, and most usecase descriptions have been developed.
* Supplementary requirements capturing the non functional requirements and any requirements that are not associated with a specific use case.
* A Software Architecture Description.
* An executable architectural prototype. 
* A revised risk list and a revised business case. 
* A development plan for the overall project, showing iterations and evaluation criteria for each iteration. 
* An updated development case specifying the process to be used.

#####Construction Phase

Construction phase is the largest phase in the project as the rest of the system is built in this phase. All the system features are developed and are added to the system in this phase.  Each deliverable of an iteration of this phase is an executable. This phase is also used in managing resources and controlling operations in order to optimize costs, schedules and quality.  At the end of this phase, a product is delivered which can be used by the end users.

* The outcomes of the construction phase is:
* the software is integrated with the platform
* User manuals
* description of the current release.


#####Transition Phase

The purpose of this phase is the transition of the software into the user environment. Once the software is delivered, then the users are asked to test the system. If any bugs are found, they are to be resolved. Also if some functionality has not been implemented then it is implemented in this phase. Also with the help of the user manuals that were generated in the previous phase, the users are allowed to transition and provide the results to this transition.

the outcomes of the transition phase include:
* beta testing to validate the new system against user expectations 
* parallel operation with a legacy system that it is replacing
* training of users and maintainers
