#Best Practices of Software Engineering in RUP

There are certain important best practices of Software Engineering that help to consistently develop bug free and efficient code within time and monetary budget. These best practices are also followed in the Rational Unified Process<sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>.

######Develop iteratively
The rational Unified Process follows an iterative model of software development. The key features of the iterative model used in RUP are:
+ It allows for changing requirements
+ Integration is performed continuously at the end of each iteration.
+ Risk management is more efficient because risks are identified during each integration process and are addressed as needed
+ The common components which are partially implemented can be identified as the need arises instead of trying to identify all the common parts at the very beginning.
+ Since the errors can be identified over each iteration, the resulting software is very reliable and robust.
+ At the end of each iteration, an assessment of the overall work is made so that the development process can be continuously improved upon.
RUP follows a very controlled approach to iterative development with a set number of iteration which run over a predetermined period of time. The responsibilities of all the people involved in the development process is also clearly identified during the development process.

######Manage requirements
Requirements management encompasses the complete process of gathering the requirement of the system, analyzing and prioritizing them, and keeping the set of prioritized requirements up-to-date with the stakeholders of the system. The Requirements management process in RUP has the following benefits<sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>:
+ Having a systematic approach to handling the requirements of a complex system helps increase the understanding of the system to be developed
+ Since both the customers and the developers have a clear view of the system being developed, the requirements management helps increase customer satisfaction.
+ Since the customers are also aware of the requirements from the first stage, the possibility of errors in the requirements is very less. This results in a lot less time being spent to fix errors due to incorrect requirements.
+ Requirements management ensures that all the people involved in the project such as the customers, users, developers, designers and testers are aware of the requirements at all times. This helps to improve communication between all the members of the project team.

######Use of Components
The design process of the RUP model are focused on the architecture. The Rational Unified Process provides a methodical, systematic way to design, develop, and validate an architecture<sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>. There are various templates which help to view the architecture from various perspectives and these templates also allow the inclusion of various rules and constraints in the architecture. The first few iterations of the RUP are focused on creating a suitable architecture for the system and identifying the risks and constraints on the architecture.
The various components of the designed architecture are used in the development of the entire system. The component based development of the Rational Unified Process is supported in the following ways<sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>:
+ During each iteration o the development, the developers can make decisions about the various components in the architecture. Decisions, such as which component can be implemented, how and by whom and which component can be reused, can be made iteratively.
+ The overall architecture helps to specify which components need to be integrated with which other components and how the various components need to be layered.
+ Layers and subsystems are some of the concepts that can be used to structure the components in accordance with the architecture.
+ Testing is performed in the bottom-up approach starting from smaller components first and gradually moving up to cover the entire architecture.

######Model visually
The Rational Unified process is completely centered on models of the system being developed. Models help us gain a better understanding of the problem and how its solution can be implemented. This is because models help us view the problem visually instead of trying to comprehend an abstract problem statement.
One of the models used in the Rational Unified Process is the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The UML provides a language for graphically modeling the various components of the system and the interactions between them. The classes of the system, the interaction between the classes and the interactions between the other components such as the interface and the database can all be visually represented using UML. This helps us view how the system needs to be developed instead of trying to understand it based on text<sup>[1](https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>.

The Rational Unified Process works side-by-side with UML to effectively develop software from the models described using UML. The RUP guides the process of creating models using UML by specifying the types of models needs for the system and explaining how these models can be constructed<sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>:

######Control changes
Since the Rational Unified Process is an iterative process, changes are made multiple times very frequently. The codes, documents, models and other artifacts are constantly updated. This helps in efficient development of the system, but it also necessitates the presence of an efficient way of tracking the changes made. This is necessary for a multitude of reasons including restoring the system to the last stable state and also ensuring that the latest version of the system is available to all the members of the development team. This also helps in tracking defects and to ensure that the project is progressing as expected. The Rational Unified Process provides and efficient change management tool to track and control the changes to the system being developed.
