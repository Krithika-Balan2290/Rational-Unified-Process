# Building Blocks of RUP

The Rational Unified Process is composed of three basic components:
+ Roles
+ Activities
+ Artifacts

######Roles
The main component in the Rational Unified Process is the Role. A role describes the behavior and responsibilities of an individual or a team working on the project. Behavior is the set of *activities* that a person or team performs once they are associated with a particular role. The person or Team with the role would have a set of responsibilities best suited for that individual or team. A person or team with a specific role is also responsible for a set of artifacts. The entity with that role has to ensure that the required artifacts are created and modified as and when necessary.

A Role is not a job title. It is possible for the role of an entity to keep changing on the same day and it is also possible for one person to be associated with multiple roles. Some examples of roles include the following<sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>:


System Analyst
The responsibilities of the system analyst role includes coordinating requirements elicitation and modeling use-cases by outlining the system's functionality and identifying the scope of the system.

Designer
A designer is responsible for designing the classes in the system and defining their properties such are attributes, functions and relationships with other classes.

Test Designer
The person team in the role of test designer is responsible for planning, implementing and evaluating the tests on the system. They also need to create the test plan and check the effectiveness of the test plan.

A role may not be an individual. It instead implies the responsibilities of each person in the organization. The assigning of roles to individuals and teams is done by the manager at the beginning of the project. The allocation of a role to any person must be done on basis of the personâ€™s skills and capabilities.

There are five main categories of roles <sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>:
+ Analyst roles
+ Developer roles
+ Tester roles
+ Manager roles
+ Production and support roles

######Activities
Activities describe the work done by each role which results in some useful output to enable the progress of the project. The activities may include creating a plan, updating a model or implementing a class. Each activity is assigned to only one role. An activity can be so small that it takes a few hours to perform or so large that it can take a week to perform. A larger activity can possibly be split up into multiple smaller sub-activities which can then be assigned to individuals in a role. 

The deliverables that are created or updated during an activity are called artifacts. Each activity can be associated with one or more artifacts. It is also possible for the same activity to be performed multiple times on a given artifact. These repeated activities are generally performed by individuals in the same role. Some examples of activities are<sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>:

+ Plan an iteration: performed by the Role: Project Manager
+ Find use cases and actors: performed by the Role: System Analyst
+ Review the design: performed by the Role: Design Reviewer
+ Execute a performance test: performed by the Role: Performance Tester
Activities are performed using one or more steps. There are three kinds of activity steps<sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>:

Thinking steps
This requires some creative thought in order to perform the step. Processes like requirements elicitation and system design fall under this category of steps.

Performing steps
In this kind of steps, the person in a role does some work in order to create or update some artifact. Use-case design and system implementation fall under this category of activity steps.

Reviewing steps
Now an individual in a reviewer role reviews the artifacts created or updated in the other steps of the process. Testing and System review fall under this category of steps.

######Artifacts
The deliverables that are created, used or updated during an activity are called artifacts. In the Rational Unified Process, the number of artifacts generated throughout the process is much larger than the final set of deliverables that are handed over to the customer. When an artifact is used to perform a given activity, the artifact is an input to the activity. On the other hand, when an activity produces and artifact, that artifact becomes the output of the activity. Artifacts are essential to the working of a project development process. Some types of artifacts are<sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>:

+ A model
+ An element within a model
+ A document
+ Source code
+ Executables


The components of an artifact can be artifacts by themselves. For example, a class in a class diagram artifact is also an artifact by itself. Like everything else in the process, artifacts are also version controlled. Instead of version controlling each sub-artifact, it might be easier to control only the larger artifact of which the sub-artifact is a part. A specific artifact is the responsibility of a specific role. Each artifact is not the responsibility of a single person, but of all the people within a single role.


Although artifacts can be documents, the RUP discourages the use of documents to maintain artifacts. Instead, it provides a variety of tools to manage the project and maintain the artifacts. Snapshots of these artifacts can be generated as and when needed using the tools. This helps to keep the information about the artifacts up-to-date and also eliminates the need of additional work to maintain documents about each artifact.
