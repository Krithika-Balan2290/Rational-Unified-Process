#Introduction to Software Development Models

#####Waterfall development

The waterfall model is a sequential software development process, used in software development processes, in which the progress of the model is downwards (like a waterfall) along the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation and maintenance.
The waterfall development model originates in the manufacturing industries. These indudtries are highly structured physical environments in which changes are quite costly and sometimes impossible. Since no formal software model existed in the earlier stages, this model was adapted for all software development purposes.
