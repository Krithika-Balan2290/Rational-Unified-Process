#Introduction to Software Development Models

###Waterfall development

The waterfall model is a sequential software development process, used in software development processes, in which the progress of the model is downwards (like a waterfall) along the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation and maintenance.
The waterfall development model originates in the manufacturing industries. These indudtries are highly structured physical environments in which changes are quite costly and sometimes impossible. Since no formal software model existed in the earlier stages, this model was adapted for all software development purposes.

###Prototyping

The Prototyping Model is a systems development method (SDM) in which an early approximation of the final system or product is built and this is called the prototype The Prototype is tested, and then worked on until an acceptable prototype is finally achieved from which the complete system or product can now be developed. This model works best in cases where not all of the requirements are known in detail ahead of time. It is an iterative, trial-and-error process that takes place between the developers and the users.

###Iterative and incremental development

Iterative and Incremental development is any combination of both iterative design or iterative method and incremental build model for software development. The model is widely used by several organisations for the development of large products.The goal of this model is to develop the product over a period a time and over several timeboxed iterations. with each iteration new features and functionalities are added with each increment at each iteration and older bugs are worked upon. The exact number and nature of the particular incremental builds and what is iterated will be specific to each individual development effort

#####Spiral development
The spiral model is a risk-driven  model generator for software projects. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such as Incremental, Prototype or Waterfall.

Each model is specific to a project, a thorough risk analysis of the project is done and based on the estimate risk, diffrent processes are adopted.

#####Rapid application development

In the Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach , lesser importance is given to planning whereas more emphasis is given on development of the product, in contrast to the waterfall model. RAD focuses on adjusting requirements in relation to the knowledge gained during the project. This causes RAD to use prototypes in place of design specifications. the RAD approache also emphasizes on a flexible process that can adapt as the project evolves rather than rigorously defining specifications and plans correctly from the start.

#####Code and fix

The code and fix model starts with no or very little initial planning. The main idea of this model is to start development of the product and then fix problems as and when they occur, until the product is delivered. This model is used for projects that have to be developed in tight time schedules, and immediate end results are to be seen. 
A major drawback of this model is that it, if there an architectural change, then large parts of the code need to be rewritten, thus making a change is hard and expensive. This model works appropriately for small projects.
