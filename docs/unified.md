# The Unified Process

The rational unified process is software development framework that is iterative and incremental in nature and was created by Rational Software Corporation, now a part of IBM. The most popular process among all of them is the rational unified process (RUP). 
The unified process is a very extensive framework, which should be customized for various projects or organizations. The unified process is often confused with the Rational Unified Process as even the Rational Unified process is customizable. The name Unified Process as opposed to Rational Unified Process is generally used to describe the generic process, including those elements which are common to most refinements.

The Unified Process enhances team productivity,  by providing access to common knowledge base, tools and templates. By doing so it is ensured that no matter what activity a team member is associated with, the entire team shares the same language, process and has a common view as to how to develop the product.

The unified process is supported by tools, these tools help in automating a large part of the process. The Unified process makes use of various visual models, this simplifies the documentation process as compared to other processes.
