# The Unified Process

The rational unified process is software development framework that is iterative and incremental in nature and was created by Rational Software Corporation, now a part of IBM. The most popular process among all of them is the rational unified process (RUP). 
The unified process is a very extensive framework, which should be customized for various projects or organizations. The unified process is often confused with the Rational Unified Process as even the Rational Unified process is customizable. The name Unified Process as opposed to Rational Unified Process is generally used to describe the generic process, including those elements which are common to most refinements.

The Unified Process enhances team productivity,  by providing access to common knowledge base, tools and templates. By doing so it is ensured that no matter what activity a team member is associated with, the entire team shares the same language, process and has a common view as to how to develop the product.

The unified process is supported by tools, these tools help in automating a large part of the process. The Unified process makes use of various visual models, this simplifies the documentation process as compared to other processes.

####Unified Process Charateristics:

######1. Iterative and incremental
The unified process is an iterative and incremental process. The phases of Unified Process that is elaboration, construction and transition are divided into a timeboxed iteration, that is these phases repeat over time. if the project is large even then even the inception phase might be divided into iterations. Each iteration results in an increment which means that after each iteration the product will contain new and additional functionalities, as compared to the previous releases. Although most of these iteration will consist of similar SDLC phases (requirement analysis, implementation, coding, testing etc.) the focus on these phases will change as we proceed with each iteration and increment.

######2. Architecture Centric
The main focus of the unified process is the architecture of the system. In the unified system, the entire project shapes according to the architecture of the product. All project efforts are planned according to the architecture of the system. The most important deliverable of this process is the executable architecture baseline which is created during the elaboration phase of the cycle. This partial execution of the system validates the architecture of the system and also acts as a foundation for the remaining project.

######3. Risk Focused
The unified process requires the project to focus on the tackling the most critical risks earlier in the cycle. Thus the deliverable in each iteration cycle is selected such that the deliverables which are potential high risk elements are addressed first. This reduces the risks of product failure at later stages thereby potentially increasing the success rate of the product.

The Unified Process describes how to effectively develop commercially proven approaches to software development for software development teams. These are called “best practices” as they have helped teams and organizations successfully develop their product. The Unified Process provides each team member with the guidelines, templates and tool necessary for the entire team to take full advantage to follow best practices: 

1. Develop software iteratively
2. Manage requirements 
3. Use component-based architectures
4. Visually model software
5. Verify software quality
6. Control changes to software
