#Rational Unified Process

The Rational Unified process is one particular implementation of the Unified process and so it is also an iterative approach to software development. The Rational Unified Process or the RUP was created by Rational Software as a framework of the software development model which can be adapted by organizations in accordance with their requirements.

The RUP is a process product that aims to assist in the production of high quality software, within the constraints of time and budget, which caters to the requirements of its end users. At the same time, the Rational unified process covers the six best practices of software Development<sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>:

1.	Develop software iteratively.
2.	Manage requirements.
3.	Use component-based architectures.
4.	Visually model software.
5.	Continuously verify software quality.
6.	Control changes to software

The Rational Unified Process is also a software product released and maintained by IBM. The process of developing a software system is maintained as a software product. There are many advantages to this approach<sup>[1]( https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Rational-Unified-Process/blob/master/docs/refs.md)</sup>:

1.	The development process can be kept up-to-date at all times. There is no issue of using ancient software development techniques.
2.	The most recent version of their product can be accessed by all members of the Team.
3.	Web tools allow the team members to access project artifacts very easily.
4.	Since the RUP product is available online, it is easy to navigate from one part of the process to another and also to external references if necessary.
5.	Process components or procedures specific to the organization can be included in the RUP product.
6.	Within an organization, it is also possible for different departments to have processes specific to their needs.
